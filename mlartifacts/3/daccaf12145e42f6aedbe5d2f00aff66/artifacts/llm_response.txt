Project Vivek
Project Vivek heralded a paradigm shift 
in your Bank’s appraisal system from 
traditional balance sheet based funding, 
to a more objective appraisal system 
using cash-flow healthiness and other 
information sources. It is a promising 
initiative launched by State Bank of India 
to implement a new Credit Underwriting 
Engine (CUE) for the SME segment, 
thereby bringing objectivity in better risk 
assessment. Moreover, it reduces TAT, 
resulting in better customer experience. 
In FY2020, a total of 33,618 proposals

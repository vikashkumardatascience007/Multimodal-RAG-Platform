entering 
into derivatives transactions. Risk on 
interbank counterparties is monitored 
through limits set for the purpose. These 
counterparties are required to execute 
ISDA with us.
Your Bank has various committees 
and departments in place to monitor 
various types of risks. The Asset Liability 
Management 
Committee 
(ALCO) 
oversees 
the 
efficient 
management 
of liquidity risks. The Market Risk 
Management 
Department 
(MRMD) 
identifies, 
measures, 
and 
monitors 
market risk associated with derivative 
transactions. MRMD also assists ALCO 
in controlling and managing these risks 
and reports compliance with policy 
prescriptions to the Risk Management 
Committee of the Board (RMCB) at 
regular intervals.
The accounting policy for derivatives has 
been drawn up in accordance with the 
RBI guidelines, the details of which are

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Your Bank has adopted an advanced 
approach for assessing the impact 
on Earnings at Risk (EaR) and Market 
Value of Equity (MVE) with pre-defined 
tolerance limits that determine the risks 
associated with them. Also, it enables 
the Management to initiate appropriate 
preventive steps in a likely scenario of 
erosion in Net Interest Income. 
To encourage branches to garner stable 
funds and assess your Bank implemented 
their profitability based on the cost of 
funds, a matched maturity-based Funds 
Transfer Pricing.
The 
Asset 
Liability 
Management 
Committee (ALCO) of your Bank monitors 
and manages liquidity and interest 
rate risks by constantly modulating the 
asset-liability mix in the balance sheet. 
ALCO, among other things, reviews 
the interest rate scenarios, the pattern 
of growth of liability products, credit 
growth, competitive advantages, liquidity 
management, adherence to the regulatory 
prescriptions and pricing of liabilities and 
assets from time to time.
To address the inherent rigidities in the 
balance sheet structure and the issue 
of quick transmission of changes in 
RBI’s policy rates, effective from 1st May, 
2019, your Bank took the lead in linking 
its pricing of Savings Bank Deposits 
(with balances above `1 lakh) and Short 
Term Loans (Cash Credit accounts and 
Overdrafts with limits above `1 lakh) to 
an external benchmark, that is, the policy 
Repo Rate.  
Subsequent to the RBI guidelines on 
External benchmark-based lending rate, 
effective from 1st October, 2019, pricing 
of all floating rate Retail and MSME loans 
are linked to the external benchmark, 
that is, the policy repo rate. However, 
the repo rate linkage of SB deposit rates 
continues.
The 
Regulatory 
Reports/ 
Returns 
pertaining to the area of Asset-Liability 
Management (Domestic Position) have 
since been automated through OFSAA, 
and the Whole Bank position is expected 
to be in place shortly.
8. ETHICS AND 
BUSINESS CONDUCT  
Since the inception of the Ethics and 
Business Conduct vertical, your Bank 
has been carrying out a host of initiatives 
and programs, attuned to permeate 
and percolate the ethical values and 
exalted behavioural norms across all 
levels. Whether it
 with strategy at the 
whole Bank level. It encompasses global 
best practices such as Risk Appetite, 
Material Risk Assessment and Risk 
Aggregation, amongst others.
As part of your Bank’s vision to transform 
the role of Risk into a Strategic function, 
a 
Board-approved 
Enterprise 
Risk 
Management (ERM) Policy is in place.
With an objective of maintaining a sound 
risk profile, your Bank has developed a 
Risk Appetite Framework incorporating 
limits for major risk metrics. For the 
promotion of a strong risk culture in your 
Bank, Risk Culture Framework is being 
operationalised in a phased manner. 
As a part of Material Risk Assessment 
Framework, a quarterly analysis of risk-
based parameters for Credit Risk, Market 
Risk, Operational Risk and Liquidity Risk, 
amongst others, is presented to the 
Enterprise and Group Risk Management 
Committee (EGRMC)/ Risk Management 
Committee of the Board (RMCB).
Your Bank conducts a comprehensive 
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process (ICAAP) exercise every year with 
respect to the adequacy of Capital under 
normal and stressed conditions. In the 
ICAAP, besides the Pillar 1 risks, such as 
Credit Risk, Market Risk and Operational 
Risk, Pillar 2 Risks, such as Liquidity 
Risk, Interest Rate Risk in Banking Book 
(IRRBB), Concentration Risk and others 
are also assessed, and capital is provided 
if required. New and emerging risks are 
identified and discussed in the ICAAP.

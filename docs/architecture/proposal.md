# 📊 Client Proposal & PPT Mapping  
**Enterprise Multimodal RAG Platform**

---

## 🎯 Client Challenge

Enterprises in **banking, healthcare, and manufacturing** manage large volumes of **multilingual, unstructured documents** (PDFs, SOPs, reports, manuals).  
Key challenges include:

- 🔍 Slow and manual information retrieval  
- ⚠️ Compliance, audit, and regulatory risk  
- 🔒 Restrictions on external cloud-based AI  
- ❓ Lack of explainability in AI-generated answers  

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

A **secure, on-premise Multimodal RAG Platform** that delivers:

- 🤖 Local LLM-powered reasoning (Ollama)  
- 🧩 Agent-driven intelligence (LangGraph)  
- 🔎 Accurate retrieval across text, tables, and images  
- 📊 End-to-end observability and auditability (MLflow)  

No data leaves the enterprise boundary.

## 🏗️ Solution Architecture (C4 View)

- 🖥️ **Enterprise UI** – Search, insights, audit views  
- ⚡ **FastAPI Gateway** – Secure API access with RBAC  
- 🧠 **LangGraph Orchestrator** – Controlled agent workflows  
- 🤖 **Ollama LLM** – On-prem inference  
- 🔎 **Vector Store** – Semantic document retrieval  
- 📈 **MLflow** – Governance, traceability, compliance  

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

- Role-based access control (RBAC)  
- Network-isolated deployment  
- Full prompt, model, and agent traceability  
- Alignment with **ISO, SOC2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS**
